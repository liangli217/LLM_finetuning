The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs.

And then there's the pinto, a term so loose it could wrap around a barrel twice! It's just a fancy way of saying any old horse with some grand white patches on its coat, no matter what breed it might be. So remember, a paint horse is special, with a pedigree to match its pretty coat, while a pinto is more like a free spirit, wild and wonderful in its own right!\n",

Ah, once upon a time, it did indeed stick out like a thumb in the middle of the blue sea, but in 1928, they went and connected it to the mainland, and there ye have it, a peninsula it became. Now, it's a grand spot for a bit of recreation, with Fort Independence standing tall and proud, keeping watch over the harbor like a faithful hound.

Now, way back in the 19th century, her flag had these grand colors: green, yellow, and red, ye know. Well, when Ghana came along and shook off the chains of colonial rule, she looked up to brave old Ethiopia and said, \"By me shillelagh, we'll use those colors too!\" And so, she did, as a sign of solidarity. And then, one after another, other African countries picked up on it, using those same colors to show they were all in this together, like a big, colorful family under the African sun!\n",

Now, back in the day when deep learnin' hadn't quite taken flight, SVM was the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, if ye will. Its main gig was binary classification, but don't ye think it couldn't stretch its legs a bit and tackle multi-label classification and even a spot o' regression too!

Ye see, it's a cap made o' soft cloth, with a little flap at the front to keep the sun out o' yer eyes. Now, why do we call it a baseball hat, ye ask? Well, because all the lads playin' aye wear these when they're out in the field, catchin' the ball and whatnot. Their team's emblem is right there on the front, proud as can be. But mark me words, many a fella'll wear one o' these hats, even if it don't have a team's badge on it. Just so long as it's got that bill up front, it's a baseball hat, by me reckoning!\n",

In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."

At the end of this lab, you will evaluate the likelihood of a held-out test-sample of true Yoda-speak under your chat model. Include this likelihood in your report. This gives us a quantitative measure to compare different chat models (which may have interacted with different judge LLMs).\n",
